@dpakman The greatest hits
Super normal sane people
@hasanthehun I nutted
If you live in California you should vote NO on prop 22 - Uber, DoorDash, Lyft &amp; Postmates have paid $200m to coerce people into thinkings its good for their drivers. In truth it allows them to deny their drivers the benefits of being an employee. Pure greed, in other words.
@VaushV Thank fuck
I can only pray that America does not want a president that openly encourages violence and intimidation of fellow citizens
@ContraPoints Very juicy idea
Hospitalization is way up too which disproves any fantasy about more testing
100k new cases in one day - or as Trump likes to call it “rounding the corner”
@bunnydelphine Hila for next presidential debate
New ep w @bunnydelphine here
Hila with the tough questions
We’re all simps today boys because we got @bunnydelphine on the pod!
@AOC You are allowed to own nice things and also want people to have healthcare. I don’t understand how those two things exclude each other.
After 2 weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were normal just for a brief moment in time.
Trump doing everything he can to kill his voters
@ohyeaaaaaaaaaah @EthansGazebo Don’t listen to him

@RSGLORYANDGOLD Wow I’m so glad he finally apologized happy for you Tony!
@Casey @teddyfresh @candicepool @HilaKleinH3 Casey what is going on in this photo lmao
I made a post during the debate quoting Trump as saying “good” in response to children being separated from their parents, but after listening to it again he clearly said “go ahead” to the moderator.  I erased the tweet, apologies for the error.
I watched back the video and he didn’t actually say that! Removed the post, apologies for the error.
@RationalDis Thank you sir 🥂

@Timcast Just take the remote call in w @SamSeder - it’s a completely reasonable request on his part, and if you were so eager to debate him you would make it happen

@CrabsAndScience Just type “horses breeding” this one is from a channel called “farmhouse fun”
So apparently people are insecure to show their side profiles? Not sure what’s the big deal 🤷‍♂️
@SLZRDmusic Yes
Isn’t it a little early to be selling “trump defeats covid” commemorative coins?
Trump just retweeted well wishes from 2019
1. Trump went to the debate knowing he may be infected  2. He lied to debate commission about testing negative  3. His family insisted on removing their masks   4. He tested positive Wednesday morning and did not warn anyone until Friday night   5. Now 25 connected infections
Finally the truth
@hasanthehun
@JordanUhl Unprecedented
@JordanUhl Keemstar is known for his factual reporting so I would definitely take his word on this
For the record I tweeted this 5 hours before the news broke he has covid, before anyone accuses me of wishing death upon him. I hope he recovers swiftly and starts encouraging people to wear masks. Thanks.
@theh3podcast the court finds this in violation of their sentencing
Imagine never having to think about Donald Trump again
@theh3podcast Justice with a side of fries
@teddyfresh
Donald Trump’s message to white supremacist: “Stand by.”
@UnreliableGarz @theh3podcast @trishapaytas What a beautiful compliment, thank you.
@teddyfresh Beautiful
Trump paid $0 in taxes the year he tweeted this
Trump is personally responsible for loans &amp; debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years. Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of foreclosing on a sitting president. I guess we’re repoing the White House
Hey dipshit you paid $750
Sorry guys I had to re do my tweet I didn’t give him enough credit 😂
Hey guys Donald Trump paid $750 in federal taxes pass it on
@prunewt Good Q
@sadfroggie Ty sweetie
Look at those juicy milkers tho🤤
@ElvisTheAlienTV Incoming pedo accusations against Elvis
And I already pay 50-55%, I have no idea how the government is unable to already pay for this but I'll pay more fuck it
I guess I'm a libtard but id happily pay more taxes if this meant this never happened to another person ever again
@mega64 @rocco_botte Relieved it’s over man thank you
It’s literally on the truck, $19.95
It’s revealing that Laura thinks there is a conspiracy to fund a u-haul rather than people being able to afford $20 to rent it for a day
@theh3podcast Talk to me baby
@caseykfrey Fuck yes dude this is amazing!!!!
@twomad Bro instant cop
hey @HilaKleinH3
Just to clarify I dont think @larrayxo did anything wrong at all, and im so grateful he enjoys our brand. I'm just trying to point out that the chance James has never seen our hoodie before is pretty much 0%.
@PoolHallCo I'll take 100,000 plz
James "I've never heard of your brand" Charles
@teddyfresh @jbecauze this gotta be one of my fave collections of all time - huge shout out to the great Dan Bortz!

Breonna Taylor Trial:  1. Only one officer was charged for firing at Breonna's NEIGHBOR, while the ones that shot DIRECTLY AT HER were acquitted.  2. The guilty officer's bond was set at $15,000. Breonna Taylor's boyfriend was set at $50,000.  The system is broken, no justice.

@HilaKleinH3 Queen shit
@Idubbbz Ty idubz
3. He has gone on a warpath when someone ripped his make-up 4. All of our fans who will be wearing their colorblock will now be mistaken as James Charles fans 😅
Why am I sharing this?  1. I think it's worth showing he admits he ripped us off with all the people who have been denying it 2.  I have no desire to take legal action so this is the closest I can get to some sense if justice before he sells a billion of these
James basically admits his team ripped of us but said it's fine because "we don't have the same fanbase or demographic".
@KevinMSasaki My fave
Earthquake - here is the cutest pics out of my phone I could find to help ease your worries
Also Theodore in the bottom 🥰
I really would never say anything but it's the exact colors in the exact spot on our most iconic item
@HilaKleinH3 Queen 👑
@teddyfresh Queen shit
@hasanthehun They probably mistook it for covid misinfo @TeamYouTube - any help ?
For context, a company made a palette with colors very similar to his and this was his response
Hmmmmm
@CrabsAndScience Unfortunately not 😔
@OMFGITSOSCAR I've heard they are friends but I'm not 100% sure
@ElvisTheAlienTV its the fact that its the same exact colors and placement, its almost identical, otherwise I would never even mention it
@_AlexHirsch Thank u mr hirsch
I give you permission to share our convo. You told me you were going to sell them anyway. You also admitted that the similarity wasn't a coincidence. I dm'd you because I wanted to keep this private but I found your response combative and dismissive.
@jamescharles I give you permission to share our convo. You told me you were going to sell them anyway. You also admitted that the similarity wasn't a coincidence. I dm'd you because I wanted to keep this private but I found your response combative and dismissive.
@HilaKleinH3 Queen
It's possible it's all a totally cosmic coincidence but he used pretty much the identical colors here too, he at least moved em around a little bit
I know we didn't invent colorblocking but I'm having a hard time w the new james charles merch, it's the same exact design as Hila's. Combined with the fact that his audience is so huge, many people will assume he designed it and start accusing us of plagarism. What do you think?
@teddyfresh Hi hila love you
@lindzi_amore @HilaKleinH3 @teddyfresh We didn't invent colorblocking.... Wish he changed the colors at least a little bit tho

Did you ask him why he fucked a 13 year old child?
@jmoney3005 What's the real number of deaths Jake? Which amount makes this okay for you, just curious?

No reason
Leafy posted this on Instagram this morning.
@theh3podcast #27 in the USA ,5.5 on wikifeet
@twomad king twomad is shocked now they done fucked up
@BrodyFoxx im fairly certain keem is getting a lot of pleasure from pushing leafy to getting banned on every platform, I wouldnt even be at all surprised if he was reporting all of his videos
@eddyburback bro it could be you, since you make 15 videos in a row about one creator and persist even after being warned by youtube - IT COULD BE YOU NEXT!!!!
The craziest part is that keemstar manually uploaded this to his storyfire channel
Keemstar casually eating wings and laughing along
Leafy confesses he went to the protests  with an illegally conceiled gun, saying he was "looking for someone to give me an excuse to shoot them". Truly disturbing.

@theh3podcast Erase this
@JonTronShow He is
@DrEricDing @WeAreSinclair @ericbolling 100%. He already has credible threats against him and his family's life. He's already been issued a security detail. Seems criminal to run that.
@DrEricDing @Revkin @oliverdarcy @mmfa @MerylKornfield Thank God... They are going to actually get Dr fauci killed with this batshit.
@JonTronShow Shaq is in every commerical prove me wrong
@OrdinaryGamers @theh3podcast It was me I sold you weed

@_Starkilla 👏👏
@theh3podcast Here's to 200,000 more!
@dark_one911 @bertkreischer You can sue for any amount you want, but he has to prove damages to quantify the amount. I bet he got max of 1 million, probably even less.
@bertkreischer He sued for 250m, they probably settled for a much much smaller amount.
@Tweet4nita I have tourettes too. I'm the eyebrow guy haha. I'm happy to see another creator out there doing their thing, appreciate ya!!

@teddyfresh Hila let's fuckin god !
I highly recommend @_Starkilla's new video about keemstar, who has been harassing his wife and calling her a witch - furthermore how keemstar is seemingly obsessed with attacking beautiful, unattainable women

@H3Out @KEEMSTAR wtf?!
@AntonisKazou @hichmoe @H3Out The keemstar playbook:   1. Start a rumor 2. Wait long enough for it to circulate so people forget you started it 3. Re-report it as known fact
@_Starkilla Keem is my favorite source of entertainment lately
@teddyfresh Hila is a professor of calculus how did u do this and why aren't u working for NASA ?
Yes guys I know it's an onion article, I do not believe that health experts are recommending people quit their job in a three step comical fashion. Yes the onion header is not included bc I got it off Reddit. I hope I answered everyone's questions please enjoy the joke. -Ethan

@_Starkilla Yep he's a great kid !!
@fribhello @_Starkilla And the video is still up despite their global marketing director saying the information is false. Now that's actually slander.
@_Starkilla Dude talking about slander. I've never even seen this photo before let alone shared it...
@_Starkilla Good
@_Starkilla He'll write himself an anonymous letter about you doing something illegal and then hire an actor to read it on drama alert

I know a lot of people find this funny but it's not, he was a real person with a real family. I don't blame him, there is so much misinformation out there and sadly his death was entirely preventable, there will be so many more like him. Please wear a mask and avoid crowds 😔

There is nothing more I can say or do about this. I've tried my best, and I've come out worse for wear. If anyone else cares, please speak up. I am profoundly sad that just one day after another tragic suicide I can read something like this.

@sooprmaus @Bowblax True
@Bowblax @hichmoe My video is also from 2016, and unlike yours, isn't actually racist 🤔
Racism is over!
@hasanthehun Wouldn't they need to disclose if they were being paid???
@Yugen_L i spent plenty of time with my son 😊
@lilweebz great question!

@teddyfresh Thanks for saying that Hila
@noahjon79954949 @HilaKleinH3 Seriously?
@HilaKleinH3 This is allegedly footage of him having a physical altercation with his wife/girlfriend. I just heard it for the first time, it's extremely disturbing.
@hichmoe @S_Ammar__ @BillBlasski @_Starkilla Holy shit I've never heard this before wtf
@AnisaJomha Anisa is good person and anyone who says otherwise doesn't know her.. simple as that.
@_Starkilla Keemstar loves playing dumb.. go ahead and explain why you started randomly tweeting pictured of a witch then? I wonder why? What a lowlife man.
@_Starkilla Oh what the fuck....so can we expect more witch tweets?
@_Starkilla Have you ever known a more petty pathetic man? That an account with only 1000 followers could get so far under his skin, it's truly remarkable.
@_Starkilla He is mentally ill - wtf is this
@_Starkilla @OrdinaryGamers good guy mutahar
@_Starkilla @OrdinaryGamers What happened?
@Caio_Paixo Were you one of the people telling me that in January too? We should be scared as fuck so we actually prevent it this time.
@teddyfresh Thanks Hila

@goodtrav98 Read the entire post. He kept getting in bed with her while drunk. He felt her up. And he did it to other people.
@teddyfresh Classic hila
@OrdinaryGamers Good for you man
@OrdinaryGamers I like him too tbh
@_Starkilla Congrats bro
Btw this is your banner right?
@d41sk @Thestigfan @Leafy This dude called me a cuck lol
@Bowblax Don't be dense. It took me 5 seconds to find it.
@Bowblax You should probably be more concerned w keemstar sending hate to a victim, while admitting he didn't even read the whole thing, than my tweet. Don't you think?
MAGA
@_Starkilla Keemstar blocks people like it's his part time job
@H3Out Simp for them all 👀

@HilaKleinH3 He defended this video with the following tweets
@MrM0saic @HilaKleinH3 No there is actually plenty of info in the post he admitted to stopping reading about 10% in
@tanib91 @HilaKleinH3 Frame this
@HilaKleinH3 Holy fuck hila I am in awe of how perfectly you put this
@LegitPanda81 Well when keemstar is your friend he will be sure not to cover it so you should be good anyway
I love when keemstar takes a strong stance AGAINST victims of sexual harassment while admitting he hasn't even read the full post - now that's what I call news!!
Keemstar got his partner status back for one day and he's already a sexual assault apologist
@ser_gio69 I was joking because I wanted to get a rise out of bill burr
truthfully i like joe brogan im just having a laf god bless and goodnight
@nunya08370230 @fribhello its okay my dude its twitter we all just saying shit we dont mean love ya
@MysteryRJP i agree he has a great show
This joke occurred to me when my third eye opened on the 7th hour of a cryotherapy session
@Jellied_Donut yes but youll never guess by who
@bumfree I spent 2 hours in my cryofreeze tank and my third eye opened
@afckinghorse Reminder to laugh
@ketzenberger @joerogan I like him just having a laf
@nunya08370230 I am devastated by this comment
@exoticgluten I am literally the most secure man alive
This original observation occured to me on the 43rd hour inside of a sensory depravation tank.
This is my original thought that occured to me in a dry sauna at 150 degrees. You cannot prove me wrong.
@MysteryRJP What if it WAS it ?!
@steve_steve___ I wrote it in my diary 5 years ago and only realized after I slammed a bottle of alpha brain
Goop = Alpha Brain for bros
Joe Rogan is the Gwenyth Paltrow for bros
@JustinVGoneril @hutchinson You should probably be more sick of the fact that, just one day after receiving partner status back, he is already throwing innocent people to the dogs..but sure fuck me for actually wanting to stop a dangerous person.
@RSGLORYANDGOLD Tony will destroy keemstar in a 1v1 3am behind mcdonalds death match i would bet on it
@CBreezy54_ @HilaKleinH3 I am devastated
@hutchinson Keemstar will never stop ruining lives and harassing people. It's only a matter of time before he does something so heinous that we all wonder why we allowed it to go on for so long.

Here is a study of 300+ of the largest protests in cities in the US. Study abstract states:  “...we find no evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than three weeks following protest onset”
@fleccas Yes and being outdoors.
@AngelsKill The paper shows no material increase in 3 weeks following protests...

@turincomplete
@tsoulichakib @CharlieBakerMA It's really not that complicated. Rate of positive tests is same across the state as among protestors.
@tsoulichakib @CharlieBakerMA They are tested... Symptoms doesn't matter.
@tsoulichakib @CharlieBakerMA How can there be a peer reviewed study, It happened 3 weeks ago? This is raw data reported by the governor.
@Luke_Polly1 @CharlieBakerMA I'm replying to everyone you're trippin'
@tsoulichakib @CharlieBakerMA It's what the governor said. Seems legit, no?
@tkirk57 @CharlieBakerMA There isnt
@ChampChong
@turincomplete I did look at my follow up tweets
@ChampChong That's not at all proof. There could be a lot of reasons why it's going up in Melbourne and not other places that had nothing to do with protests.
@fleccas If people wear masks then we don't need lock down, that's correct.
@ChampChong I don't know much about the protests there but if that were true you would see the same increase in NYC but it has remained completely stable.
@ChrisRBarron If everyone wears a mask then yes lock downs are unnecessary it looks like. Social distancing is not a lie, it's just another preventation measure.
@bigboytendies Precaution is not evidence
@Lixinct Not evidence
@CrosKH @bigsabbie Not evidence
@bigsabbie That is not evidence that protests increased covid. Red states re-opened way too soon, did not wear masks and gathered in doors. Cases are focused in Florida, Arizona and Texas.
@bigman69999999 Tru
@FemCrusaders Love u too god bless
@FemCrusaders Do you have any evidence to support that?
Because it was out doors and majority of people wore masks. Here is proof
@bolinbolinn @RAPT0R22 Additionally, the protestors did not choose the timing, it was the result of an untimely death. I'm sure there would have been a lot more people at the protests if there was no covid.
Protests did not result in substantial increase because it was out doors and most wore masks, proof:    The main problem is people refusing to wear masks
@H3Out H3 did blackface don't tell the commentary channels
@RAPT0R22 Protests did not result in substantial increase because it was out doors and most wore masks, proof:    The main problem is people refusing to wear masks

@A_Lonely_Loner I 100% agree it wasn't ideal. Data shows the spread was not that bad, though. Its wrong to place the current peak at their feet when people in hotspots have been refusing to wear masks and mingling in doors since the lock down lifted.
@BigPoppaMD You may be remembering me too fondly lol
@PhillyD Both series are gems
Wearing a mask should not be a political issue. It doesn't make you a bitch. You wear it to protect others. It makes you a considerate human being.
@DRMC0DE Wearing masks.
@DRMC0DE Death increase follows 2 weeks behind case increase. We will start to see an increase in deaths soon, although 500 deaths per day is not really great either, is it?
@BadxBeast LA has remained stable, not California. Huge protests in La yet the city had remained relatively stable.
Furthermore you can see the emerging hotspots are in Florida, Arizona and Texas
@BadxBeast LA has remained stable, as you can see the hotspots are emerging in Arizona, Florida and texas
Before you blame protestors, recent data shows almost no uptick. This is due to the fact that it took place out doors and most people wore masks. The influx in infections is coming almost exclusively from red states without widespread protests
@BadxBeast Protests are certainly not ideal but they took place out doors which greatly reduces transmission and most wore masks, recent data shows almost no spike from protests. The influx is coming almost exclusively from red states without major protests
@ProfessorWowa The surge is happening in red states that did not have large scale protests
The cost of turning public health into politics.
@_Amz_10 @OrdinaryGamers They don't give a shit about public safety, they do it to protect the economy and status quo.
@_Starkilla H3 hates men
@AurelianofRome No I believe what he said is all flirting is rape
@GlinkLive @FurryHunter75 Yes
@FurryHunter75 Lol he's in the backseat what a cuck
@umelecher1 No
The Inceling
@AOC Congratulations Representative 💪
@_Amz_10 @OrdinaryGamers I hate the government, but they are smart about containment. They are hardcore and know the threat it presents to their economy &amp; stability. I believe them when they say infection is low. They had a small flare up recently and did a major local shut down
@_Amz_10 @OrdinaryGamers I'm talking about current amount of infections. They are fully reopened. If they had an active spread they would be in lock down.
@_Amz_10 @OrdinaryGamers That's good but he wants to slow it down 🤷‍♂️
@_Amz_10 @OrdinaryGamers What about China? Their megacities make London &amp; NY look like suburbs
@OrdinaryGamers USA is among the lowest of developed nations on testing per infection
@OrdinaryGamers Much of EU, Japan, China, new Zealand have pretty much stopped the spread. I think he's trying to gaslight people into thinking our infections are soaring because we do more raw testing, truth is he doesn't wear a mask therefore many do not too, &amp; our testing is low per infection
@ElitoSama More population does not mean more infection, it just means that the government has failed to reduce transmission. There was a time when we had only a hand full of infections. Tests per infection shows how good our efforts are at containing the spread, regardless of population
@ThomasK54132429 Fair enough!
@realJosueVega1 @byte2lol But that's not true. Other countries test more than we do.
@ElitoSama I agree that's what he's implying but he's wrong. Testing per confirmed case, which is the best way to estimate the infection rate of our population, is among the lowest of developed counties.
@thebeigesheep You are assuming that rampant unchecked spread of the virus will not kill more people and adversely affect the economy than a lockdown. Virtually all health experts disagree with that.
@biggestmando But we know that isn't true. Amount of tests per confirmed case is the best way to show how infected we are as a population. USA is among the lowest of developed counties.
The consensus of people defending it seems to be "technically it is true", but he is implying something, so what is he implying? Seems to be that he is justifying reducing reducing testing, right? How do you justify reducing testing?
@LuxxBTW It's like saying technically 2+2 = 4, what is his intentions in tweeting that? What's he implying?
@King_K_Drool Damn true
@OhTooToxic @KEEMSTAR He blocked me 😔
Let's argue - someone defend this
@MrQuietking China doesn't report their numbers. Obviously more population requires more testing, that's just logical, right? That's why it's being expressed per capita.
@EricaRenee2490 I remember a bunch of commentary channels making videos calling me a fear mongerer 🤷‍♂️
Here is the result
This implies that other countries have more cases but are testing less, which is not true. The USA, shown below, has one of the lowest testing rates in the developed world.
@H3Out You are my official archivist lol
@Dingler_Justin @eddyburback It implies other countries have more cases but are testing less, which isn't true.
@eddyburback I stopped wiping so there is no poop it works just saying

@SubToOptimus @JohnSwanYT @zaptiee @Nicholas_DeOrio Because when we announced it we had no idea what it really meant to run an organization that fights lawsuits and dmca - the amount of money we would need would be in the millions annually and it would become my full time job. We tried for a while and it was not sustainable.
@Komfort_V_Dub @zaptiee @Nicholas_DeOrio Just referring to some fund raising ideas we had - this is long ago before the hell of fighting the lawsuit and realizing how expensive lawyers are.
@JohnSwanYT @zaptiee @Nicholas_DeOrio How is it my responsibility to take on every false claim a YouTuber gets because I once fought a legal case for fair use? Logistically that doesn't even make sense. Its way easier for someone to dispute, I even made a video on it
@zaptiee @Nicholas_DeOrio You don't understand the mental toll that that lawsuit had on me and Hila and then the subsequent conspiracy theories to undo it, to say I don't care about the community is just not true man.
@zaptiee @Nicholas_DeOrio The conclusion of your video is that I never cared about the YouTube community.. doesn't sound like much benefit of the doubt.
@ToastyTime Sometimes that's the best thing to do...Good luck man!
@_Starkilla @hichamelfe Thank you my dude
@Bowblax @_Starkilla Hi Josh, I used your videos a lot during our keemstar research. I know you don't like me but your videos were really helpful so thank you.
For those that don't know, keemstar has been tweeting me pictures of horses non stop for two weeks because he thinks my wife looks like a horse. Pathetic, I know.
It's too bad keemstar blocked me. I was looking forward to more tweets of his making fun of my wife's appearance.
@KEEMSTAR
@ColossalisCrazy @NetNobody I totally understand where you're coming from, I think, just to give bash the benefit of the doubt, he was prob just in a really fucking wild place - I watched your vid on him and I think it was totally fairly made on some wild behavior. I see where both of u guys are coming from
@eddyburback fucking love you eddy
@gamerfrommars Hi Art, keemstar tweeted a DM of you guys talking which led me to believe you are friends with him. Something I believe you should disclose when making a video so intimately about him. You clearly put a lot into that documentary tho and I enjoyed it a lot

Fathers need to talk to their sons about consent and boundaries. I never got that talk, I don't blame my dad, I think it just wasn't done. But adding this chapter to "The Birds &amp; The Bees" will make a better world for everyone.
@ToastyTime Good luck bashur!! I am very much looking forward to hearing what you have to say about all of this... It's so sad that someone can straight up lie about you sleeping with a 13 year old, later change the story, but so many people just remember "13". I hope it clears your name 🙏
@HilaKleinH3 Oh hi Hila
@NetNobody If you have information I'm missing then I'd be happy to hear it, that was the original purpose of this conversation. You can dm me if you want to convey privately
@NetNobody I think you could probably do more to help bashur out if you are worried about the negative effects of all of this drama - just my 2 cents! He lost literally everything. Still, I am sorry about the rough time you're going thru. The internet is cruel. Best
I fully support women coming forward regarding sexual assault. It is terrifying to put yourself out there on the internet &amp; I applaud their bravery. And to the men who use their fame to prey on women,  you can't get away w this shit any more. Wake the fuck up.
@motdraw1 Hi Tom I am generally media adverse but thank you for the invitation
@NetNobody I'm sorry, I'm afraid I didn't understand the question
@NetNobody Sure! It showed his pattern of disregarding mental health, regardless of the resolution you guys had between each other. Cheers
@NetNobody Hmmm. Ok, I'll think about that. Thanks again.
@NetNobody You're definitely right I don't know enough about it, it's pretty difficult to untangle everything in that story. That's why I'm asking, trying to figure it out. No worries, thanks again.
@NetNobody I've seen that video. I find his narrative a little questionable since him and keemstar are friends, but it's fine I'll try to piece things together. Thank you. Sorry, did not intend to upset. Just genuinely curious. Best
@NetNobody Would you mind showing me where you corrected the record? I cant find it. Thank you!
@NetNobody Oh okay. I couldn't find it. I'm not trying anything, was just curious. From what I can tell this is where the rumor began and a lot of people still think he's a pedophile based on this comment.
@NetNobody hey Adam - I'm curious if you ever correct the record on this claim?
@_Starkilla 😭
@_Starkilla I 100% want to walk away and not think about keemstar or get shit from people, trust me I am way happier not dealing with this shit. Thank you for observing that 🙏
@_Starkilla This video is heartbreaking
@_Starkilla @HilaKleinH3 Rep yer naysh boi
@SkyWilliams @Garrett_madd Just wanted to make sure you knew what it was all good
@_Starkilla Woah wtf he sent this to you?
@twomad Thank you
@SkyWilliams @Garrett_madd It's titled the black challenge because we did a bunch of colors before that all called "the *blank* challenge"
@SkyWilliams @Garrett_madd It's a video about beauty products, nothing to do with race. 🤷‍♂️
Keemstar thinks sexual assault is entertainment
Keemstar is a threat to the YouTube Ecosystem, he is circumventing the safe guards by spelling "rape" as "R4PE".
He has proven he is not responsible to report on any such matter, as his clear bias, inability to do thorough research, and willingness to lie to create "drama", makes him an incredibly dangerous force on YouTube.
Keemstar is again reporting on extremely serious sexual assault allegations. Remember that we as a community are allowing him to continue to ruin people's lives.  For example, the pic of Tom in his thumbnail is from him crying that a make-a-wish child had passed on - WTF?!
@CrabsAndScience @teddyfresh Lol nice angle 😍😍😍😍 will immediately make banner on all pages😂
@iTzXKillerBunge All witnesses said they did not hear knocking or announcement, only shots.
@iTzXKillerBunge They executed a no knock forced entry in the middle of the night without announcing themselves - her boyfriend thought they were being burglarized and opened fire. They shot indiscriminately into the house and killed her. Afterwards, they falsified the police report.
Breonna Taylor’s name is no longer trending &amp; the police that murdered her are still free. The police filed a report that was nearly blank. It stated that she had no injuries, even though she died from gunshot wounds. It stated no forced entry, tho they entered w a battering ram

@KEEMSTAR Me literally saying it's not racial 🙄
@andymilonakis @KEEMSTAR Unfortunately I tried to ignore him for 3 years and the result was him convincing most of YouTube that I stole money from Fupa and committed Fraud. I've tried that 😔
@andymilonakis @KEEMSTAR I appreciate you wanting to end this but as I try to sit back quietly for the past 3 weeks, keemstar has:  1. Called hila a horse about 20 times 2. Called me George Soros of YouTube 3. Digging thru every old tweet ive ever made  I don't think it's fair to pretend we're equal
@KEEMSTAR It's mud from the deadsea, it's tradition to cover yourself in the mud there because it's good for the skin. I admit the caption is in really poor taste tho for sure. Thanks for pointing it out so I could erase the tweet😔

@Gokanaru @ColossalisCrazy @KEEMSTAR In isolation I think you're right, but youtube was probably not happy about him trying to skirt their guidelines. So if we consider the context of the original, it makes sense they removed it.
@Nicholas_DeOrio @ColossalisCrazy @KEEMSTAR Because, like all things, he's lying about the reason he was suspended
@Gokanaru @ColossalisCrazy @KEEMSTAR Btw I'm not saying I agree w their decision, only that I understand why it was removed, because you can still clearly see the gun.
@Gokanaru @ColossalisCrazy @KEEMSTAR I understand why it was removed again, if you reshot it with a plunger then it would probably have stayed up, but you can clearly see the gun in your hand most of the time. What I don't understand is that if you guys wanted it to stay up, why not just cut the last 3 minutes?
@ColossalisCrazy @KEEMSTAR @Gokanaru I never watched the plunger version, I said of the original that I wasn't surprised they took it down. I never advocated for it to be removed.
@BillBaines_ @PimpMasterYoda1 right, that was another lie keemstar said, no body told me anything about stopping making videos - why do you believe anything he says?
@KEEMSTAR report my video to youtube if you think its in violating - i got nothing to do with it, just telling you the facts.
@KEEMSTAR Keem's and gokanaru's is the same video and leafy's was reinstated - there are a trillion videos critical of me on youtube....gokanaru's video, where everyone just edits the last 3 minutes out of, is still up.

He has also been the cause of two lawsuits that resulted in the state paying out a total of $1,000,000 - one of which is the video above, which cost $175,000 in a settlement from Commerce City, Colorado.
Even after having a well documented history of abuse &amp; violence, he was able to get another job in another station. He tasered a veteran suffering from PTSD several times while his partner clubbed him in the head.
One man stopped the looting - some people seem confused...
@Bl4ckD0g57 @killajilla They threw a metal barricade in front of his car that's when he slowed down
@killajilla Is he not trying to mow down protestors? He was speeding up towards them. See any other cars on the road?
holy shit

This is the video I lost subscribers for. #blacklivesmatter
First time being happy that I lost subscribers from a video
@OneAngryGamerHD Wtf did I do?!
@GazebosEthan I am still somewhat confused I will admit because I always thought you were all the same person and I'm somewhat mind blown that is not the case.....
@GazebosEthan I am so sorry for your loss 😔 your gazebos have been the bright point of many of my days, it will be sorely missed. Me and Dan used to discuss your gazebos and frequently rate them. I've also enjoyed, at times, keeping you honest as the posts were clearly not gazebos. Love you🙏
@GazebosEthan How did I missread that 🤦

@thatguypnell @LilNasX Hahahahaha
@themodalice @LilNasX Thanks for the suggestion, I won't take it though.
@ElijahSchaffer @theh3podcast @TuckerCarlson You are so fragile
I love that he thinks calling Tucker Carlson a "cunt" is "hate" and not accusing @LilNasX of inciting a riot on national TV simply because he donated to a bail bond charity for protestors. Talk about snowflake. I suggest growing a thicker skin.

Is this what they teach in the academy?
@AngeloShorees Exactly
This is not the beaches of Normandy, these are your children and neighbors. Shooting at medics is something Nazis didnt even do on the battlefield, so why do these police have so much disdain for their fellow citizens? It's just utterly depressing.
@anthonypadilla Take that Batman shirt off he would be ashamed
@LilNasX What a fuckin cunt
Good point
@fhhrgrg I can't tell if you're serious or not
black lives matter
so this is where the police draw the line.... GOT IT.

George Floyd is looking down from heaven with a single tear of joy for our unemployment numbers 😇
@KEEMSTAR What?!???! Impossible!! I'm calling Susan right now!!!!!!
"We're about to beat the shit out of everyone here, would you fine gentleman please stay inside so our racism isn't blatantly obvious? Thank you kindly 😊"
@paigeoldfield22 Somehow I couldn't say it any better than this flextape meme
@CountDankulaTV Again I have no idea why his videos were removed, I haven't seen either of them, so it's hard for me to make a judgement. It can definitely feel arbitrary tho, that's why you gotta be extra mindful these days. Cheers man, I'm sorry about your situation and wish you well.
@CountDankulaTV But everyone is looking to scapegoat me but we are all living in the same harsh reality, ultimately it's his responsibility to make content that is not so risky as to be removed. It's a trade off we've all had to make. He needs to own up to it &amp; stop scapegoating me.
@CountDankulaTV Nobody went after leafys channel, he violated community guidelines and that's why they were removed. People mass flag every video of his and mine, so obviously we need to be prepared to be under extra scrutiny, I understand your nervousness tho and i wish you well.
@CountDankulaTV I wouldn't help Jaystation If his channel was removed. I'd say good riddance.
@CountDankulaTV Most YouTubers with any notable size have a YouTube rep, same as me. You want me to get shit on &amp; lied about and just smile and lobby for them. It's weird. I defended you because you were right. I don't even know what leafy did that resulted in his videos being taken down.
@CountDankulaTV He tweets out, with no evidence at all, that I'm trying to get his channel removed. And I'm the asshole. Anyway, what magic powers do I have to help him?
@Inferno33963829 @ouighounours I'm talking about investing in schools not buying and passing out drugs
@ouighounours Public schools are funded in large part by property taxes. Rich neighborhoods therefore have significantly higher budgets. See the problem?
I am a card carrying member of Mensa if anyone is wondering and I can complete a rubix cube with my nipples only
NYPD gets 6 billion a year...I have a crazy idea... Take 3 of the 6 billion and invest it into low income communities... Thereby lowering crime and poverty... and the need for so many police🤯
@_Starkilla Dude what a fuckin coward HOLY GOD! His Twitter feed is his safe space, poor @KEEMSTAR is so fragile 😔
@_Starkilla @KEEMSTAR I would like to respond but it would result in a dozen new 30 minute videos about me
Justice is served at 0:30
@CommentCopped @jaubreyYT thank you comment cop
@jaubreyYT sorry but if you think me taking a picture with susan is evidence that I'm conspiring to have his channel removed then you are a fucking idiot
@jaubreyYT Right. Someone just accused me of trying to get their channel deleted. I should just let them say whatever they want, like I have for the past 3 years, until everyone thinks I'm actually evil.
Meanwhile his friends are begging me to help, poor leafy :( Bash me publicly and beg me privately.
Of course I'll spell it out, I had nothing to do with it, I never reported his videos and its very bizarre that he thinks I wield some godlike power to remove his videos. But no. not me sorry.
And nothing of value was lost
This is now it was described in the police report
@RSGLORYANDGOLD I do believe you have created your masterpiece
@RSGLORYANDGOLD holy shit Tony LMAO!!!!!!

@ShoeyChris @KEEMSTAR @PhillyD @JohnScarce People saying "not right now" - im just backing shoenice up since keem is denying it ever happened.
@ShoeyChris @KEEMSTAR @PhillyD @JohnScarce Its funny, even back in 2016, it was "another fake rape allegation", four years later and he hasn't stopped accusing people of rape and pedophilia. He ruins lives in exchange for cash. I can't think of a more loathsome way to make a living.
So, as proof that racism does exist, just look at all the people trying to justify his life being snuffed out on film over 9 minutes... sick fucks can't just accept the man was murdered without trying to assassinate his character too.
@CrabsAndScience Congrats dude!!!!!!
@ShoeyChris @KEEMSTAR @PhillyD @JohnScarce Just so he isn't able to gaslight you @ShoeyChris into thinking it didn't happen. It definitely happened. And I knew it was fucked up back then too.
@ShoeyChris @KEEMSTAR Hey @KEEMSTAR here is our DM conversation of me telling you to take down your accusations against @ShoeyChris and you telling me no because "he's mad" and "there has to be a story there". @PhillyD @JohnScarce
This is who George Floyd was. Rest in peace.

Congratulations my dudes @mystical_haki @EjSalonga @odisrobin19
@TheGraphicKing @KEEMSTAR Of course she is 😊 she's one of the greatest people alive and beautiful as anyone I've known
@KEEMSTAR I mean it's obviously meant for hila, all the edgy kids say she looks like a horse, I'm just shocked that you would even tweet
@wroetoshaw @KEEMSTAR I would hug him, but he would accuse me of rape
@KEEMSTAR So you're statement is that it didn't happen? Have you lost track of all your false allegations?
@KEEMSTAR Sure I'll respond to it - did you accuse shoenice of being a rapist and block him?
@KEEMSTAR And keemstar let's not forget you called shoenice a child rapist and blocked him instead of apologizing so let's address that first before trying to change the subject
@KEEMSTAR Yeah well you lied about like 8 people being rapists so not sure you are the right person to hate on anyone
He was driving with that thing on too ready to rumble with the halo ultimate weapon damn
I would like to know who cruises around with this type of weaponry?!

I'm honestly shocked by keemstars new video. He spends a large portion of it dragging TONY of all people and INSINUATING that he's a fuckin pedophile for real. This is just beyond insane. Poor Tony didn't deserve any of this. Wtf man. Why.
Keemstar confirms he has the emotional maturity of a 12 year old by dismissing my criticism as me being "big mad".
@theh3podcast @marcrebillet Thank you Marc you legend
@blartio That I can't argue with
@blartio Thanks for your concern, she is quite healthy and beautiful
@Moyumii I am so so sorry for your loss 😔

@_chstp @KEEMSTAR Keemstar's alt Twitter account spotted
Can we all appreciate that this video of @KEEMSTAR LITERALLY SLANDERING ME is still on his channel? Will I need to involve lawyers too before he removes it?
I've been following this story and the coverage of it is outright criminal, negligent, and the perfect example of why keemstar should not have a news story. Great video @Deji I'm so sorry you've been the victim of this.

@HilaKleinH3 tru
Daniel "Sponsors Are Sacred" Keem
Anyone up for a new video today? :)
"Ethan is the first person to mention a sponsor"  Keemstar: hold my gfuel
Suicide I'm talking about Fousey not etika based on what he said for the record
call people pedos, frauds, rapists, con artist, assassinate their character, harass them up to the point of suicide - JUST DONT MENTION THEIR SPONSOR GFUEL THAT IS ON THEIR DESK IN EVERY VIDEO!
@KEEMSTAR Ok thanks for response I will retract my tweet unlike your video accusing me of fraud
@Fizzz____ My video isn't monetized
Keemstar wears gfuel hat in every video &amp; has gfuel on his desk in every video, its as much a part of him as his beard, its part of his identity. I didnt go after any of his other sponsors but this one is part of who he is. If gfuel dropped keemstar  it's keemstars fault.

@EDP445 Who the fuck would block EDP
@ChrisRGun I will never forgive u for ripping me off
@Boogie2988 thats consistent with everything else he's said about mental illness so I definitely believe it. I'm sorry that happened to you.
Dear @KEEMSTAR this video has been proven wrong and yet is still up - When will you retract it and publicly apologize?
This is Tony the guy keemstar accused of being a pedophile and then told him to fuck off. Thank you guys for showing him love, he deserves it.💕
@RSGLORYANDGOLD Love you Tony
And I most certainly did not blame keemstar for etikas death. I think he created an extremely toxic environment for him and others.
"I don't care about false allegations of pedophilia or felonies, doxxing, swatting, belittling mental illness but Ethan has gone too far making fun of gfuel"
Blessings to you winners for the day: @distrumental21 @Fishk33per @JLee412  Wish ya the best and good luck 💕
@KEEMSTAR @garypeter69 me or the fake account you responded to? Please clarify.
Here is a glimpse at @KEEMSTAR research - he responded to a fake h3h3 account 😂😂😂
@CrabsAndScience i cant believe youve done this
Hopefully it's with a retraction and an apology

The face of the master race
I got a letter from the department of justice, I can show up to his hearing to testify ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The dude who swatted us multiple times just went to prison and he looks exactly like I expected him to. Known neo-nazi. Don't swat, kids. You will go to prison.
@JoeySalads Thank you Joey Salads
@HilaKleinH3 I was gonna do that before the quarantine
@EDP445 Mos def but this ain't da real EDP - still cool tho
Retweet is required for the twitter bot to pick a winner, and comment is required to get their PayPal info. I didn't ask them to follow me or even like the tweet. Sorry it's gross.
@TheBrianMcManus It's how twitter bots work to pick winners. I'm not asking them to even follow me.
@AndrewYang Thank you Andrew... This is definitely an Andrew Yang inspired initiative 😂🙏
I will try and expand the offerings beyond PayPal but it's difficult to move such a large amount of money w other revenues! Working on it!
@TheMasterBucks I was racked by this issue too. There isn't a good way. Ultimately I think almost everyone needs help right now and people who are rich are hopefully not applying, even if so its a minority. I think for the most part it should reach people who truly need it.
Will clarify on future tweets but it does not need to be your email address, just your link!
H.E.L.P. Day #1 - We are giving away $500 to two people for the next 100 days. To enter simply retweet and respond with your PayPal email address. The winners will be randomly selected in 24 hours and announced then. We hope this reaches some of you in your time of need. -E&amp;H
@kellimorrisonxo You need to issue a w9 for any amount over $600.

We're giving away $100,000 over the next 100 days. #HELP
@trishapaytas Do you really think you need any help fucking up relationships?
@trishapaytas Bitch you were up here trying to have a thruple with us like two weeks ago talking about me being a 10 - and by the way, get an editor, don't have time to watch you cry on your kitchen for 30 min, this video should be 10min tops damn
@JoeySalads I'd definitely lose, she has the strength of 9 people in there!!
@trishapaytas I'm sure the love of your life moses is thrilled to hear of your intentions to fuck my dad 😂

Eyes on the road!!!!!
@OrdinaryGamers Video where I talked about it is from March 19
@SwitchLogin @OrdinaryGamers It's from March 19 🤷‍♂️ I
@OrdinaryGamers March 20 is when I tweeted and Jeff donated on April 2. So no, I did not donation shame him.
@OrdinaryGamers Just so you know, I never shamed Jeff Bezos donation. I tweeted two weeks before he donated simply wondering if he would, and he did. I think it's great that he donated 100m and I would not deminish the value of it based on his networth. Cheers
@DrEricDing @theh3podcast Thank you Dr!!!!
@theh3podcast @DrEricDing God bless

New vid here boys
@EthansGazebo bro this photo is so weird
New video is about YouTuber SoYoung who eats animals live - Squids, Octopus, everything. It's truly horrific, shocking and utterly fucking disgusting. This video I made is damn near unwatchable from the pure disgust and revulsion you will feel. Enjoy!
@adultswim @psychicpebble Make this a series right now
@fleccas Nobody is
Donny boy gonna vote by mail tho fuck that he ain't risking the polls w the plebs
There is a literal pandemic Don
@Gusbuckets It's called integrity. They know their pizza snaps and if he wants it he can poney up that $2.50 during these trying times. Giving the pizza influences the review. If anything they are the only true ten because they DO NOT play politics. They play pizza. -Ethan
@Casey Wtf is quibii and how do I get some of those marketing dollars
@EDP445 What else do you love?
We DID NOT, for the record, purchase any locally made pizza to help stimulate the economy.
@Casey @Wil_n12 @HilaKleinH3 I dream of a day where we judge pizza not by the origin of it's city but by the content of its crust.
@Casey @Wil_n12 @HilaKleinH3 You dress like a hipster from 2,000,000 BC
@MMAScoutLive That's a really good question

@theh3podcast I'm sorry Ian
@teddyfresh All the ladies in the house say wayo
@PrisonPlanet Why is he pretending? And further, why do you care?
@PrisonPlanet Paul serious question - should we stone sex workers to death or just sterilize them? Lmk
@overusedtbh Go ahead and unpack it for me professor
@jessg83ny Wow okay
Idubbbz is a cuck for not making his girlfriend walk at least 3 feet behind him at all times 😡
I've committed the cardinal sin of thinking that sex workers are worthy of being loved - paul you probably have more in common with isis at this point. Cheers!

@EDP445 hired
@feather_oar Our businesses are shut down and all of our 20 employees are being paid their full salary and health insurance for the entire duration of this - I'm not really sure what more I can do than that. I don't have 130 billion dollars with unlimited manufacturing capacity.
@JamesBarnsley30 Jeff Bezos is like 130,000,000 times richer than me
Our businesses are shut down and all of our 20 employees are being paid their full salary and health insurance for the entire duration of this - I'm not really sure what more I can do than that. I don't have 130 billion dollars with unlimited manufacturing capacity.
@bulbasaur_123 Yes he has, quite a lot. Amazon revolutionized the entire world, especially USA. But now lets see that beautiful bald head jump into action for the greater good, and not for a profit.
@Charliesh00ts @MichaelLHenton both
@freshodb no
@MichaelLHenton k
@MichaelLHenton They have taken so much from society for huge personal gain. Now is a time of national crisis and they have the resources to give back and make an impact. I believe they have a moral obligation to help. If not, we cannot justify the massive resources they hoard.
@MichaelLHenton nope but it would be thoughtful dont you think?
I'm curious if billionaires are going to ride or die for America in the next 12 weeks and mass produce ventilators, or if they will retreat to their apocalypse bunkers. We are about to find out if they have value to our society or not.  #WhereIsJeffBezos

@GooseWayneTV Get back to the part where I hate my country because I want more testing
@GooseWayneTV So you approve of governments poor response because it will kill more people? And that makes you love your country? And I hate it because I don't want people to die? K
@GooseWayneTV I would ask our government that who is apparently intent on killing millions of us...

This is "advanced screening" at our airports... shoulder-to-shoulder for 6 hours. If these people didn't have COVID, they do now. The utter incompetence of our government to contain this virus is mind-bending.

@TheRealOJ32 Statistically I may have a better chance of being killed by you than the virus
@notch @emeraldcitycon @MayorJenny @DrEricDing Go ahead and enjoy the convention 🤙
@antoniocurveira It's a pandemic. They catch the disease and bring it back to their community. The mortality rate includes everyone, healthy, elderly, and those w weakened immune system.  Why do people think we should not protect elderly and those with auto-immune disease from death? WTF
@BhutlahBrohan cool lets just let them die
@antoniocurveira What did I say that you disagree with?
Corona virus is not just the flu - it has mortality rate of between 2-5%. The flu has 0.1%. Additionally, it will overwhelm our hospitals and doctors preventing other people with more urgent issues from getting timely care. 2% of USA population would equal 7,000,000 deaths.
Comic Con is refusing to cancel their Seattle Convention in Mid March despite it being the epicenter of CoronaVirus in USA. They are bringing 100k+ people from around the country. This will be an absolute disaster if it is not stopped.  cc:@emeraldcitycon,@MayorJenny,@DrEricDing
@DrEricDing @emeraldcitycon To the Mayor Of Seattle @MayorJenny please do not let this happen
@DrEricDing @emeraldcitycon For the love of god no

@PhillyD keep me in that top 5 baby lets gooooo😂
@GP_Tweets1 I understand your point, but do you acknowledge that they have some type of advantage though? If so, what can be done about that?
@almirlisto @HilaKleinH3 @FuturegamesEDU @teddyfresh 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
@JamesGlodo @MikeBloomberg It's real I'm afraid
The moment @MikeBloomberg's campaign ended, when he hired fuckjerry to make him look cool. What a nightmare.
@GibiOfficial Ty gibi for thoughtful answer
@Olivertree That's a beautiful bowl my dude
@Zenaltra Ok can you tell me why?
@kenbone18 @tranimator Ty Mr bone
@GP_Tweets1 Can you tell me why?
@ydontihavapenis There are "real" trans people here offering their opinion. Feel free to add yours and I would gladly consider your perspective.
@swishfilet Can you explain why?
And if you do think it is transphobic then do you acknowledge that they may have an unfair competitive advantage? If so, what is the solution?
Genuine question: is it considered transphobic to think that people born biologically male that have transitioned to female should not compete against females in competitive sports?
@lil_h3 @BernieSanders @LilNasX I definitely appreciate your dedication
@AndrewYang MVP
I am officially endorsing @BernieSanders for president with a $1,000 donation. Although take my endorsement with a grain of salt because my qualification is that I talk about poop on a podcast all day. That being said, I do support Bernie and wish him good luck.
Thank you @AndrewYang for transcending party lines and showing us the campaign of the future - Looking forward to what's next for you 🧢
@TeamYouTube added for more clarity
@H3Out @TeamYouTube woah that crumb flying out of his mouth is wild
@loolitsjulian @TeamYouTube seeking attention online because you don't get enough in real life
This is the effect of an incorrect classifier on a YouTube video - I'm very grateful that @TeamYouTube fixed the mistake, but I think it needs to be discussed how dangerous this can be for a creator's wellbeing and livelihood.
@teddyfresh What does it mean
Can we please appreciate the irony of YouTube accusing Papa of using the N word?! This has never happened on any of our other 180 episodes!
Looks like the reason YouTube demonetized &amp; removed the video from trending is this.. And let me be clear.. **HE DID NOT SAY THAT**  You'd think there would be more systems in place before taking down a 2 hour podcast.  Or does the pizza conspiracy go deeper than we think?
@TeamYouTube Thanks but they should listen twice before claiming a racial slur was used. Glad you guys were able to fix it tho. Thank you
Shout out to @TeamYouTube for demonetizing Papa John interview and removing it from trending
@theh3podcast
They said it couldn't happen. It wouldn't happen. They said Papa John would never be in the house. I'm here to tell you that Papa is in the house. And he always has been. Papa Bless
@theh3podcast PAPA BLESS!
@commentiquette @TeamYouTube @XavierCalvera WE MUST RESTORE THE SKELETON BAND @TeamYouTube

@TeamYouTube -Worldwide block is the new abused tool of YouTube.  -Offenders do not need to file a DMCA, which is a legal document w/ coincequences -Even after dispute, videos w Worldwide block cannot be brought back -Worst of all since they dont sign DMCA, you cannot sue them
@TeamYouTube -New podcast is blocked worldwide. -Fraudulent claim. -Cannot trim it out. -Even after disputed it stays down. -I have NO recourse and my business is completely shut down.  -Worldwide block is too easy to abuse &amp; victims have NO remedy! HELP!!

@teddyfresh @Czuux we will have stuff on the website again soon i promise
@Olivertree you did this
@CDisillusion Clearly you have never shoved a goop crystal healing egg up your butt!
Here is the entire screen shot for proof
As many of you know if am a supporter of @AndrewYang and the media has been playing him so dirty - but this has to be my favorite so far by @CNBC - I guess all Asians look alike according to them.
500,000,000 animals have perished in the Australia wildfire
@RubberNinja I have.. so painful.
The war of our lifetime is not with Iran or any other country - it's with man-made climate change. There is no more time for ignorance or debate - this is what it's doing to our planet.
@notslxxpy Yes. There are people in our own god damned country without clean drinking water. Yet we are supposed to celebrate 2 trillion on tanks.
How are we not all done with this constant state of war?! Since I've been a child we've been at war. We are literally evaporating our efforts and resources into oblivion. Trillions of dollars burned in a giant pile instead of investing in the betterment of all life - why?
As an American I'm so sick of people waging war on my behalf. Bragging about spending 2 trillion on tanks when people can't pay for healthcare or school lunches is sick beyond belief.
@sam_vallely 🧢🧢🧢🧢!!!!! We'll play it when the podcast returns 🙏🦅

Watch this and ask yourself why this is a partisan issue.
@JonTronShow Oy govanha ! innit!
@evan_breen The most important thing is to find a therapist and tell them about it asap - you've got to understand that those feelings are not real but a manifestation of a depression that is cureable. Please speak with a professional asap!

@grandayy That's a good point forgive my ignorance
And please follow the advice of a doctor that went to school for 12 years and not someone on Twitter with a Minecraft avatar god bless
@GazebosEthan @EthansGazebo Nice looking young lad
@MarioKartGuy27 I wrote this tweet at 7am - what time should I wake up for you to feel better?
Also I would like to say to please not let other people's negative experiences affect your decision. There is no way to know how they were using the medicine and under what supervisor etc - I let someone's bad experience prevent me from getting help for a year and regret that
Also I would never recommend an antidepressant without also getting therapy but I don't think there is such a stigma around therapy as there is around antidepressants! Either way, doing something is always better than doing nothing! God bless
My intention is not to endorse a specific product only to highlight that taking medicine and getting help was a very difficult decision to make but an important turning point in my adult life. A psychiatrist will obviously prescribe the right medicine for you!
I take Lexapro every day and its been one of the single best decisions I have ever made. I never thought I would take an antidepressant bc I felt shame &amp; weakness, but its actually the opposite, i feel stronger &amp; proud of myself for getting help😊 #MentalHealthAwarenessDay
I will be going to bed now and not because anyone on Twitter told me to but because it is the appropriate time and I am tired goodnight
@PeartEightOh sike bitch
@PeartEightOh ok
We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Fattest Cloud.

@SanaBha55241347 No I haven't deleted it, it's quite easy to check and see using
@DANNYonPC You do not have authorization to screen shot my tweets @FBI
It's #InternationalLesbianDay today for those that don't know. Good morning everyone 🌞 I just woke up. Good chance of this tweet being deleted in about 7 min when hila wakes up and sees what I've done.
Should I keep or delete the tweet the choice is yours my good people
What a coincidence! I just celebrated #InternationalLesbianDay last night before I went to bed!
@Matthiasiam @TeamYouTube @YTAdvertisers How in God's name does YouTube approve that?
@bunnydelphine Great job Belle, keep it up. Proud of you.

@timedsteele Bernie has worked over a 60 year career and has accumulated a modest amount of wealth when compared to his associates in Congress who sit upon vast fortunes of 100s of millions. Regardless, he is a Democratic Socialist not a communist. Learn the difference.
Terrible typo. Why have I done this. He is still very much alive.
LOOKS* LIKE!
Why am I going in on clownstar? Because Keem thinks he can talk shit on anyone with impunity bc hes such a vindictive pyschopath that people know its not worth responding, but Id like to take this opportunity to reinforcement what everyone knows: Keem is the biggest clown on YT🤡
Keemstar meanwhile feverishly telling all of his "researchers" to dig up any dirt on me they can, even if it's flat out false. Tool. 🤡Clownstar🤡
Keem when ur channel gets banned for 3rd time you will have a bright future making animals shaped balloons at children's parties 🤡
Clownstar
Looking forward to keemstar manically trying to "destroy my career" for the next year!
By the way he's angry because I said drama alert is ISIS's favorite news station which is pretty funny let's be honest
I would be more concerned if you actually liked my content ya muppet

@theh3podcast Well said my fuper truper!!!!! Not sure who wrote this though but well said. Who wrote this?
@gregorybrothers @YouTube @TeamYouTube This kind of thing happens to me all time too. I never click but the videos follow me around for months on homepage &amp; suggested
@marcrebillet He didn't say he hates his fans just that he has trouble with meet and greets. I always welcome my guests being honest, and I think the audience do too.  But it's okay that we have different opinions about it. God bless
@marcrebillet I understand ur reaction, but ultimately people's suffering is real whether you relate to it or not. Its why you see a lot of celebrities dealing w drug abuse, depression and suicide. People dont want to hear them complain bc they "have everything". Fame doesnt make u less human.
@ElvisTheAlienTV Lucky

@pewdiepie Meanwhile good luck deciding if I'm a backstabbing hater of PewDiePie or a defender - instead of a nuanced human being with different opinions in different situations. #ad
@pewdiepie Oh I forgot to disclose #ad - I wasn't paid or anything, but being Jewish somehow explains why I'm defending PewDiePie instead of the fact that people are getting triggered over nothing - I do not care at all about the ADL #ad
@TheQuartering @pewdiepie The dude is trying to turn a new leaf - if anyone is concerned about his money it's you, and how much you can make by sensationalizing his donation for your own gain. Enjoy da clickbait &amp; looking forward to seeing my face in your next thumbnail - good luck w the ad rev! ❄️
For the record I've been sitting on this gif for months and im so glad I've been able to finally use it, god bless

@i_am_thebaptist @HilaKleinH3 A “red herring fallacy” is a distraction from the argument typically with some sentiment that seems to be relevant but isn’t really on-topic.

@HilaKleinH3 A false memory is a psychological phenomenon where a person recalls something that did not happen or that something happened differently from the way it happened.
@HilaKleinH3 fyi
@PhillyD That's real advice👏

@hambdmah @fleccas That's helpful!
@JoeySalads @fleccas Your quote says "allegedly". Let's see the court filings.
You know your channel is fucked when you need to include *NOT CLICKBAIT* in your thumbnails lmao
@JoeySalads @fleccas There seems to be two separate accounts. How can we know which is the right one? Genuinely curious.

@100soft @realDailyWire And daily wire it you know what's good for you I would reach out directly to artist to make amends. @benshapiro
@100soft @realDailyWire This is blatant copyright infringement. Talk to an attorney. Considering they are selling it as well. These are real damaged with real consequences. If you can't afford it you can easily find one to share settlement. Slam dunk case.

@TheRealOJ32 @Patriots Glad to see OJ loving life 😊 it's nice to know that there is hope for a peaceful life for anyone, even someone who brutally murdered two people in cold blood! Take care Twitter world!
@theh3podcast 😎
@JoeySalads You named 2 - wife, trump... team? Security, house keeper, front gate guard, personal assistant, children - and more - point being that they were very close. I can't imagine being that close to someone and not knowing what they're up to. Epstein wasn't even that secretive.
@fleccas Also curious to read about his level of cooperation in the civil suit if you have any literature.
@fleccas According to sources I've been able to find he cut ties with him over a real estate dispute. He never mentioned anything about him being a predator as the reason:     Do you have evidence of the contrary?
Hyped about this new @teddyfresh coming out next week 🔥🐻
@Penthouse I need to ask for hilas permission first
@smileyfac_e This is compelling evidence
Can anyone provide proof of trump cutting ties with Epstein? And if so, when? I cannot find any evidence beyond a trump quote from this year.
Thank you everyone for participating, lots of useful information was gathered and I love you all no matter which side of this you fall on - Genuinely just curious. god bless
@Johnpage123456 I thought he cut ties in 1997 - When did he cut ties?   Obviously we know he said this in 2002 so the specific date does matter.
People are saying he cut ties with him in 1997 because he assaulted a girl but he said this in 2002
@Knock_Knock_NxT From 2002 - doesn't sound like someone who cut ties in 1997 - right?
@StarValentino1 This quote is from 2002 so how does that line up for you?
They were clearly long time friends right? How else am I to interpret this?
@ShangoriGannos @irjimmyg I don't think Epstein's "black book" just had anyone. There was a particular association to his "hobby".
@StarValentino1 How can you be this close of friends with someone for so long (both rich and powerful playboys w similar taste) and not know what Epstein does in his free time? Seems unlikely to me.   Also Trump flew with him on Lolita express in 1997
How can you be this close of friends with someone for so long (both rich and powerful playboys w similar taste) and not know what Epstein does in his free time? Seems unlikely to me.
@StarValentino1 Not guilty but some suspicion is warranted, no?
And yes I know Clinton flew on his plane  like 26 times and probably partook in the evilness. That's not in question
@Knock_Knock_NxT Recently unsealed documents showed that Trump flew on his private plane "The Lolita Express" in 1997 - surely it was all going on then, right?
Mainly I'm seeing "just two rich dudes at a club" but: -Epstein had 14 numbers in his notorious blackbook for Trump -Trump flew on the "Lolita Express" in 1997 -In 1992 Trump organized a party at Mar-a-Largo w 28 calendar girls. Trump and Epstein were the only 2 male attendants
@irjimmyg Epstein had 14 different phone numbers for Trump in his black book - thoughts?
@joeb0425 Well, he's kicking it with Jeffrey Epstein, to start.
I'm not trying to be partisan, genuinely curious. I see lots of Clinton killing Epstein conspiracies but President Trump seems to be getting a pass for his closeness to Epstein and I'm wondering what's the justification?
Trump supporter I am genuinely curious what your take on this video clip is?
@AndrewYang Haven't we already done enough for Puerto Rico?
Not a joke either it really was found in his house
This painting of Bill Clinton was found in Epstein's house. I just thought everyone should know that.
@Brackers123 @GrossieGore @Twitch Stockholm Syndrome
@GrossieGore @Twitch Does anyone know what he's talking about when he says he's the only person that knows what it's like to go without twitch? Does he mean that he held a job outside twitch or a different streaming platform? Genuinely curious.

@MacGrubing_ I since ur being ironic and it that's the case then meet me in McDonald's parking lot at 3am to settle this - ventura &amp; sepulveda 3am tonight
I am taking this public for the common good of all mankind. Once the driver picked up my order I watched as he stopped at three different locations. When the food arrived it was soggy. $30 is nice but soggy tatertots are irredeemable. I am the Martin Luther King of food delivery.

@Pokediger1 @Postmates It's not even worth it anymore it's out of control , and it screws over the driver too because people think they just taking forever.
Right @HilaKleinH3 ?
@Postmates I hate to say this but I may have to stop ordering from you forever. My last three orders have had the driver pick up multiple deliveries from different locations and the food is cold and soggy by the time it arrives. Happens every time now. This is goodbye.⚰️🌹

@TheLetterE_ Just got a juicy check from the democrats for this tweet 🤑 How could anyone be offended by this image unless they were paid?!?!?!?!🤑🤑🤑
This baby was discharged and then brought back to the hospital at the White House's request 🧚👼
Although this orphan tragically lost both of his parents in the El Paso shooting, at least he will always have this picture of the president grinning with a big thumbs up to cherish😁👍 What a beautiful photo opportunity! 💕
@Zach_Graumann @AndrewYang Can one run for president from prison? Please let us know @MichaelAvenatti
@MichaelAvenatti @AndrewYang Michael I would say Yang has a much better chance than you considering you're in prison.
@teddyfresh @ben_awin 🐻🌪️
Had the pleasure of having presidential candidate @AndrewYang on the podcast today. Facinating guy with great ideas - very appreciative for the opportunity to interview him 🙏🗽
@brookehouts I'm serious btw my dms are open to you
@brookehouts Im in la and will literally buy your dog from you name any price, he really does need a new home.

@HilaKleinH3 Hila was playing GTA last night and this morning she accidentally stepped on shredders foot. #gamesaretoblame
@Sethrogen Loved every minute of this show praying for season 2 🙏
"Don't get political." Why are you even on Twitter then? Get your fragile ass outta here.  "I watch you to escape politics." I've always discussed politics, I only hear from your weak ass when you disagree with me.  First amendment bitch, love it or leave it, remember? 🗽
Sandy Hook wasn't a terrorist attack and  hate crime - does anyone really buy this shit? Be a man for once in your life and just own up and lead - who is tired of this overgrown child playing the victim?
@ToxicTikToks It's already cheese
@ParisHilton @YouTube Hey sis
To everyone telling me to stay out of politics - I have the same amount of political experience that the President did when he took office😊   I think what you meant to say is "You disagree with me politically and I am too fragile to deal with this"
If I were to blame a culture of violence on anything it would be the president playfully flirting with calls to shoot immigrants - which is exactly what happened
The president just blamed video games for the increase of shootings - does anyone actually believe this except for fox news and crusty old boomers who have never held a controller?
@_AlexHirsch I'm a big fan but please don't disrespect the victims after only two years, too soon
@adam22 @trishapaytas @lenatheplug I would rather put my dick in a panini grill - no offense of course
@neiltyson Neil's been smoking DeGrass
Wait nevermind it's video games lol - The whole conversation is steering off course already, nothing will happen and we'll all forget about this in two days. See you guys next time🗽
I'm telling you the propoganda machine is in over drive right now to further divide the county
Don't let Russian bots convince you that this isn't something we should worry about #EnoughIsEnough
Neil says it's all good guys! Apparently we don't need to worry about mass shootings because it kills less people than the Flu 👌🗽

I'm going to boycott all of this because @UMG 's continued, blatant and flagrant abuse of copyright is a determent to entire YouTube ecosystem. I'd ask that @TeamYouTube cancels this partnership until they make good faith efforts to improve their methods. #BoycottUMG

@vLionMan @Banks @TTfue I would imagine he signed a holistic NDA when he joined faze and is operating under that original agreement.
@Banks @TTfue This tweet seems like a breach of confidentiality which could void any NDA you may have signed @TTfue, meaning you could release the contract yourself.

Going to war with Colonel D-Bag and Ultra who blocked our latest podcast worldwide. It's all part of a larger picture where copyright has become rampant to the point that its damaging the fabric of YouTube and large companies need to held responsible...
Preparing to get high AF happy 4/20
@ultra @theh3podcast Someone needs to set it to auto block and set the rules on what % of the video was used. The clip made up 1-2min of a 2 hour podcast so the automation must have been set to "any %" and block. So either you set that or whoever is managing your copyright.
@ultra @theh3podcast Too late, took down the video and cut that part out. Check who manages your copyrights because they are doing an awful job. Ultra aggressive and bad faith. What's the point of viral marketing if you block it when people talk about it!?
@Boogie2988 Dm!
@theh3podcast @ultra @kfc Thank you @kfc and @ultra really appreciate you guys for blocking my content immediately without considering fair use as is required by law

When it comes to mass shooters:  -Don't share their name -Don't share their face -Don't share their writings -Don't share their videos -Don't make them infamous  They are nothing - let's keep it that way.  I'm so sorry for everyone in Christchurch, what a tragedy.
@teddyfresh 😭 Dogs are treasures on this planet 😭
@BatmanGoose @pewdiepie Thats very sweet of her to say
@Idubbbz when you were at my house last, it was so rank I thought I was in a gas chamber, keep your farts in your own god damn neighborhoods you bigot

@tomsegura Michael Jackson is innocent he didn't have a childhood that's why he sleeps with the same child in bed for 30 nights straight without parents - did I mention he didn't have a childhood?
@tomsegura
@pewdiepie Needs more jump cuts tbh
@notch I will keep trying and you will come one day 😊 but was that a pass or a somewhat interested but a little nervous possibly yes?
@hankgreen Amazing
@timheidecker @PwhipBgang Dude admits to sleeping frequently in bed with children without parents present - it's a more wild assumption to assume he never tried anything with them.
@timheidecker I'm with you Tim read this thread here
@Banks You are on one hand saying you believe he is a prolific child predator and on the other hand saying people shouldn't talk about it? That really doesn't make any sense. What about the victims being accused of lying? Don't they have the right to defend themselves?
@Banks Why does it matter if he's alive or not? He would deny it as he always has. He was possibly the most prolific child predators of all time and a master groomer and manipulator. It's about the victims story and it's an important one. They deserve public support to encourage others.
@zealotonpc First hand accounts of multiple people and lots of evidence to corroborate their whole story including videos, recorded phone calls, faxes, photos. Watch all three parts and let me know what ya think
@OfficialGabeW Bye &amp; enjoy supporting a child molester, hope it never happens to your children or your family
@jessetbowers "know your facts fam?" Nice copy pasta - have you by chance seen the documentary?
@Ize @Jordan_Crocker1 You obviously have not watched the documentary
@DaveStansberry @Jordan_Crocker1 Thank you
@Jordan_Crocker1 They are not being compensated in any way - what money? One sued him and it was dismissed because too much time had passed (nothing to do with the merits) the other has never brought a suit or expected any monetary compensation.
So much respect and love to the brave victims and to Oprah for taking this on. The amount of hate and slander they are receiving is horrifying. Love &amp; appreciation to them all.
Michael Jackson is a child molester.  I don't see enough people talking about #LeavingNeverland &amp; those that do are desperate to discredit the victims but if you watch all 3 parts it's undeniable. It's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen on the topic. Love to the victims
@zumiez @teddyfresh 🤘🐻🤘
@notch come on h3 podcast plz
@OMFGITSOSCAR I tried to save him 😭
@miel Solid case easy win litigation wise, they have already admit to fault in dms and to counter-dmca you have to exhibit good faith that you believe you are right - these dms plainly show that they knew they were wrong and still filed. Easy win.

@2gay2lift @tallfuzzball Sorry we didn't get to the do the Podcast Adum :( With the amount of drama generated around this simple booking we figured it was best to avoid the whole thing.
@tallfuzzball Sorry you got harassed for this - seems counter productive to avoid having a conversation at all rather than sitting down with someone you perceive as trans-phobic and learning about each other. Also the claim I'm transphobic is absurd. Best regards

@FINALLEVEL You tell em ice
@grande1899 @DolanDark YouTube likes it, so much that it's guaranteed to remove the strike after ~10 days. The language is intentionally scary to prevent people abusing the system, but it's built for your protection. Sadly the big companies know how to game it and capitalize on that fear!
@DolanDark You can dispute it again once denied
@DolanDark Dispute it all the way down the line, you'll get it back! All of it too because of the new escrow account feature they added - you can dm me if u ever want advice about claims or dmca stuff
@redban @TheComedyStore @HilaKleinH3 @theh3podcast @KILLTONY 🙏🙏🙏🙏

The full Alex Jones stream that was shutdown yesterday is up:    We were able to continue offline and follow the updates from YouTube as to why our stream was shut down. Weird &amp; wild stuff.  But our channel was reinstated &amp; we can stream again next week🙏
@boburnham @YouTube After ten years of reviewing we have determined this video is NOT suitable for advertisers.
Our ability to Livestream @theh3podcast  has been revoked so we'll have to continue filming it offline and upload it later. Nice one @TeamYouTube

@ChrisRGun @TeamYouTube  any idea?
@ChrisRGun Wait, what do you mean?? Your network or youtube? never heard of youtube not paying out
I've never done a long tweet image like this before, is it readable or too small?
Regarding my comments about Roseanne
@thenerdcity Thats becoming less true on YouTube as "sensational" things are demonetized and promoted less, but they most likely would never shut you down for anything less than blatant hate speech.
@MattMcGorry @davidcrosss "you didn't like my joke and I've held a grudge for two years"
@SamHarrisOrg @elonmusk @BretStephensNYT Too many tabloids masquerading as journalists. Now when someone like Musk dares to speak up he's condemned as a trumpesque anti-media tyrant. The real problem is traditional media is fighting for online clicks and have become accustomed to degrading themselves to sensationalism
@TaylorLorenz Examine the title of the article, ‘YouTube's Biggest Philanthropist’ Has a History of Homophobic Comments -- it's written like you're exposing him. 'Homophobic comments' is the entire focal point of the headline. Why?
@TaylorLorenz You know what's the worst part of your article? You on one hand celebrate his philanthropy, while on the other hand paint him as an unsavory bigot, the kind of reporting that makes sponsors drop people. If this affects his sponsors then he can no longer do philanthropy.
Hmm, I wonder what could be dredged up about this reporter that should overshadow her entire life and achievements? Why act as if saying a few inappropriate things as a young man is equal to a career of philanthropy and good? You know it's a stretch even as you wrote it.
@TheAtlantic @TaylorLorenz Hmm, I wonder what could be dredged up about this reporter that should overshadow her entire life and achievements? Why act as if saying a few inappropriate things as a young man is equal to a career of philanthropy and good? You know it's a stretch even as you wrote it.
@CaseyNeistat @HilaKleinH3 @teddyfresh GOD BLESS !
@Some_BlackGuy I would be surprised by that, yes.
@ChrisRGun This is the greatest thing I've ever seen. I've been speechlessly blown away by everyone attempting to dance on his grave. Rest in peace John, their bitching is a testament to your legacy.💕🙏
@theh3podcast @commentiquette Let's flipping do this ya dips
@teddyfresh @ben_awin @mitchytucker7 🐻
@sahaj_amatya
Looks normal from my perspective , but I did spend 2 hours photoshopping this, so you be the judge.
The biggest take away from our new video about Youtube's cataclysmic subfeed change... is that my arm is fucked.  From the h3h3 subreddit 🙏
@Totalbiscuit Damn. Rest in peace John.
@SecondYellowCrd @TeamYouTube Exactly
@TeamYouTube You guys are just getting started. Touching the sub feed at all is a slippery slope. You start like this and in a year it will become the new norm for everyone.
YouTube has announce that it has plans to "optimize" the subfeed, which means they will stop showing videos there in chronological order and instead show you in a "personalized order". The final step in removing any control users have over content they see
The sub feed was the last place that was untouched by YouTube's "optimization". Now YT can make ur channel completely invisible even to ur own subscribers. Stop wasting our time @TeamYouTube - just erase the sub button already and show us what you want us to watch.

@Linsenbigler_24 @ellitrash420 I'm a liberal
@ellitrash420 I agree, but if you think Bruno Mars is guilty of cultural appropriation, then you can accuse it of anyone. And that seems to be what's happening.
America has always been the world's melting pot -- what happened? Bruno Mars is not allowed to be inspired by other cultures? Are we moving back to segregation now? The dude is Puerto Rican, Filipino and Jewish, how can you lecture him on mixing cultures?! Get real.
@karlskinner38 @YodelOnline Yodel where u at????

@MorkCrispy "made it"
And a special thank you to M-howitzer from /r/h3h3productions who was gracious enough to bring this horrible example of fupa discrimination to my attention.
I saw this on wikiHow and wanted to say that I'm AGAINST fupa shaming! I believe that all fupa loads can be cradled tenderly, whether you decide to strap it like you're earthquake-proofing a water heater, or let it ride like a fupa mullet, that is a personal choice &amp; I support u

@p1cklepro @TeamYouTube Can you show me a screenshot?
missing everywhere except the playlist that I added it to on our homepage
You probably missed our newest podcast because its literally not even showing on our channel, forget sub feed (which its not there), its not even in the videos tab! How is this possible after all this time, @TeamYouTube ? Regardless, you can enjoy it here
@alt_J God bless

@Some_BlackGuy Or just edit it out lol
YouTube says his infractions include trying to monetize a video that violates the company’s guidelines, encouraging his followers to do the Tide Pod challenge, and, in one recent video, taking a fish out of his pond to jokingly give it CPR and then tasering a dead rat.
@mikeboydvideo @teddyfresh @HilaKleinH3 😊🙏🐻
@Totalbiscuit @TeamYouTube (and so is YouTube!)
@Totalbiscuit @TeamYouTube AdSense isn't nothing when you have 300m+ views per month , he's losing at least like 500k+ from this
It was clear that Logan hadn't changed at all and was making a mockery of YouTube. Great job @TeamYouTube delivering swift and deserved justice. Sacrificing their golden boy for the good of mankind. Also, got em
@LauknessMonster Interesting

@pewdiepie Congratulations and well deserved. The most consistent, hard working, focused channel on YouTube. If anything you get less credit than you deserve. Keep it up, proud of you. 💕

@karljackson38 @HilaKleinH3 You look amazing!!! Love these pics my doggie!!!! ☺️🙏🙏🙏
@teddyfresh Yes from Shredder
@jordanbpeterson Come back on the podcast soon to promote your book!! Loved this interview, excellent work.
@sean_stinks I'm not sure I'm qualified to advise, is there not another place for them to stay?
@sean_stinks Who, what?!
@karljackson38 @PostMalone 😂was a ton of fun my dude even though I suuuuck
@Glam_And_Gore @prele As far as I'm aware that isn't true
@prele That didn't help but it was started from terrorist extremists having ads on their videos, small unchecked creators.
@prele It doesn't hurt you beyond losing $100 at the benefits of increasing stability across the entire platform. I know it sucks badly but it's necessary
This is #1 headline in USA.. the love is pouring in for America's most beloved celebrity!!!!!
Wtf even is Twitter news anymore...
Passionate creators should not be dissuaded by this, this is a positive change for YouTube in my opinion. It took us a year to get 1000 subs, it wasn't at all about money then, and over that time we made about $100.
I know it sucks if you're affected, but the amount of $ a new creator stands to lose is at most around $100. On the other hand, this will have a HUGE impact on protecting the now delicate YouTube ecosystem. And once you make it, you'll be on solid ground!
I personally think the new YouTube partner changes are a good thing. It's kind of insane to let ANYONE post and make money, it encourages copyright infringement, extremist, spiderman &amp; Elsa creeps, and other shady stuff, it's what caused the adpocolypse to begin with.
@RockLeeSmile @HilaKleinH3 @teddyfresh Thank you man 😭🙏🙏
@NigmaNoname Royalty free 😔
*NEW VIDEO!*  I know the subject of Logan Paul has been talked about to death, but I thought we still had something interesting to offer having seen it all play out from afar. Appreciate ya &amp; god bless

Ok,, thanks everyone for your input, I'll erase the tweet now, I'll attempt to combine a logan paul video with a harambe vid
@ImAllexxTV hell ye, thanks dude
@anything4views I should have phrased that differently because there is a lot of harambe enthusiasm lately that could skew the vote
@PointlessBlog Thank you man 🙏
@Danfer22 😂thanks Daniel, hope you're great
@Jack_Septic_Eye 😭thank you Jack, appreciate ya
@maxmoefoe 😍😍😍
@pewdiepie As if you are the only person to criticize him, get real. Don't worry, they are literally writing for no body. Who is left reading these sites anymore, I feel like they've alienated their own fan base with these articles. All that's left is outrage clicks.
Twitter news aka "Witchhunt News"  has hit a new low for me after accusing @shanedawson of being a pedophile based on jokes from 5 years ago. After he call it bullshit they run the headline "Shane Dawson denies being a pedophile", no shit you hacks. The bar is set lower every day
@karljackson38 @barshens @thetomska 😍👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏
@felixaesthetix @TeamYouTube I think it's a nice way of saying it's cancelled
Although I disagreed with the many that thought his channel should be removed, this punishment is warranted and I'm glad to see it. Sometimes it take time for these things to work through the bureaucracy of a company the size of YouTube. Glad u guys did the right thing! 🙏
Just heard from YouTube that Logan Paul's channel was removed from Google Preferred and his Red Series put on hold 👏👏👏 good job @TeamYouTube
@EthanBradberry Vid?

@jordanbpeterson @TeamYouTube any insight on this?
@psychicpebble And a giant red arrow pointing at the body
@psychicpebble Make sure that he was on the side with the time stamp so it didn't cover the body.
I think you need to see this thumnbail to grasp how bad the Logan Paul video is.
Image this: Logan Paul trying to frame up a dangling corpse in the background of a photograph for his thumbnail. Just a little to the left....
I'm gone for ONE day and Logan Paul is trending with a dead body in thumbnail... 2018 here we come!
Wishing u all a productive, happy &amp; fulfilling new year. Its been the best &amp; worst year for me, but feeling blessed to have such great people in my life, including our fans who have always encourged and supported us. Were disappearing for 2 weeks &amp; and then back strong for 2018💖

@SmoshIan @HilaKleinH3 we all got lung cancer that night, vape naysh 🙏
@TeamYouTube @LeonLush @ImAllexxTV Wat, now I'm more confused than ever.
@ImAllexxTV @LeonLush @TeamYouTube It's gotta be due to trusted flaggers imo. They are just shooting first and asking questions second right now. So if any old flaggers comes around they will re-demonetize just to be safe, and it can keep happening.  It's whack. But Im almost certain comments don't affect anything
@LeonLush @TeamYouTube I think they are just saying based on reports and trusted flaggers snitching on u to YouTube
@thenerdcity @tweetoftheBeast Another excellent video 🙏
Photos from @HilaKleinH3 's 30th bday party, such a great &amp; wholesome time w wonderful people 🙏❤️🎉

@Kurz_Gesagt Thanks for the great content Philipp, finally got around to supporting you guys on Patreon, been meaning to forever. Keep slammin ❤️
@OverkillsTWD Let's go boi!
@ElvisTheAlienTV Also a lot of people hire seasonal help since December is always the craziest part of the year
@ElvisTheAlienTV I haven't used them myself, but I know there are customer support services that can help carry the load, although its pretty personal thing to hand off, especially when youre dealing with fans. U could always get someone part time, its worth it to keep your focus on what matters!
@jcmendoza2 @teddyfresh should be arriving in the next couple of days!
@mikeboydvideo @teddyfresh @Kim_norrie nice hat :D appreciate ya dude!!!! Just watched your how to break a glass with your voice video and noticed you wearing our hat!! Loved the video -- DM me your address and we'll send ya some more teddy fresh. Appreciate ya!
@hankgreen Toms take is my favorite youtube channel, I love Tom he is a legend
@The_Plum_Lord @TeamYouTube I actually don't know what their plan was but it was something nice and thoughtful for sure
@The_Plum_Lord @TeamYouTube They probably would have had me doing the Irish jig during a motion blur for .25 seconds
Thanks to @TeamYouTube for inviting us to YouTubeRewind this year, sadly we had to reject their offer because they said we couldn't do it in white face. (Just kidding, we couldn't make it because of scheduling.) Very happy to be invited though! 🤗
@sean_stinks Is that all you got? More coins coming soon
@Boogie2988 lol who the hell thinks that? fuck them dude you keep slammin
@bemeapp Vape naysh, nice job guys!
Look how tiny he is 😢oh Lord 😭
@TeamYouTube @thenerdcity Ok! Thanks for the clarification!
Our new puppy Shredder 😭😭😭💖💖💖💖😢😢😢HES PERFECT😭
@TeamYouTube @thenerdcity So those codes only refer to ad types &amp; campaigns? Not restrictions for cursing, sexuality, etc, as nerdcity alleged?
@NathanZed Never
@NathanZed Yep I see it
@HilaKleinH3 @vgLeahbee @vgdunkey U guys r truly da best🤗
@Browntown1111 @KEEMSTAR @thenerdcity @TeamYouTube No, complaining is my super power.
@KEEMSTAR @thenerdcity @TeamYouTube Would be an interesting study to compare median views on monetised videos vs yellowed videos since the adpoclyse and see how big the discrepancy is.
@CaseyNeistat @PhillyD 🙏
@thenerdcity It's possible that the yellow mark doesn't affect search and discovery, but I doubt the codes were removed to "avoid confusion". If you wanted to avoid confusion you would tell us what the codes mean instead of hiding them. @TeamYouTube
@JuliusJJ2 @thenerdcity Sorry to disagree but @TeamYouTube is the only branch actively reaching out and attempting to help. I think YouTube needs to be much more transparent but at least now there is some dialogue.
Youtube's response to the @thenerdcity video about hidden demonetization codes, what do you guys think?
Credit to the incredible @gwillustration , check him out!! 🙏🙏
@massiveismental I recall bugs that took years to fix but this was the fastest hotfix in YouTube history, pretty interesting.
@Boogie2988 @JonTronShow Appreciate ya Boogz
@SmoshIan Happy bday anthony u have always been my favorite smosh pokemon :)
These tweets aren't meant as a humble brag. I've sensed that some think we havent been honest about our financial situation, so I wanted to be clear as possible so our fans support us for the right reasons. Appreciate and love ya all so much for your gracious support #papablessed
Today, when we talk about issues like demonetization, our intention is not to give the impression we are struggling, but to shed light on problems with the platform that affect everyone. Wanted to clarify &amp; apologize incase u had the wrong impression about our financial situation
When the lawsuit happened, this definitely was not the case. We were making significantly less and the costs would completely devastate us, we're very grateful for all the support we received then, and it made all the difference for us during that time.
I want to make clear to our fans that financially we are doing better than we ever have in our careers, thanks to the podcast, merch &amp; Teddy Fresh. If you received signals that we are somehow struggling financially, I want you to know that wasn't our intention and it isnt true.
@ChrisRGun @teddyfresh @HilaKleinH3 🙏 great hanging last night appreciate ya!
@sean_stinks 🤗
Going live w @JonTronShow
Thank you @SmoshIan you sweet gentle man. Love u @jacksfilms &amp; @ElliottcMorgan , honored to share the stage w u you two hilarious dudes🙏
@TeamYouTube @TheIronArmenian Thank you guys for the response!
@sean_stinks tired of our voices yet?
Such a great video about YouTube demonetization by @thenerdcity , he poses an extremely important question -- Does demonetization also reduce views? Evidence points to yes. Super well made &amp; entertaining. Appreciate ya.
@TeamYouTube Sorry, his tag is @TheIronArmenian
@TeamYouTube Can you guys help out @TheIronArmenianvideo ? His channel and videos have been age-restricted because of his educational-history channel has "nazi" in the title, clearly a mistake, right?
@thenerdcity Great video my dude. Demonetization is one thing, but actually reducing the amount of views a video gets is insidious, especially when the system is making so many mistakes, or when the bot can't tell the difference between parody/satire and actual smut. Appreciate ya
@PenelopeGazin very inspiring thank you
@jules_su @HilaKleinH3 Thats our local Joe's, Shoulda said hi!!!! 😣 Appreciate ya , see ya next time
@theh3podcast @JonTronShow 🤗
@KEEMSTAR Its always been ur Achilles's heel tho. U just compared ur news show to an opinion based podcast, dont you see the problem with that? Our disagreements go way back before any of this, I'm sure it's hard for both of us to put it to rest. I'm trying to let it go tho &amp; wish u peace.
@KEEMSTAR I understand that you think we are enemies, and that's fine. And to be frank, I should have reacted more professionally towards you during the pdp podcast, and I do apologize for that. I hope someday you are able to distinguish between journalism and personal vendetta.
@KEEMSTAR It's not my job to do research for you.
@KEEMSTAR 8. We never asked anyone for money. We never intended to. Philip Defranco started the campaign to support our lawsuit.
@KEEMSTAR 4. We won the lawsuit, but did not sue for attorney fees 5. Matt Hoss is pizza delivery boy, suing him for fees would double our costs and yield no repayment 6. This is all on record 7. If you want a refund for your $2500 just ask
@KEEMSTAR Some simple research may serve you in the future: 1. Donations were made explicitly to support our lawsuit 2. We decided afterwards to make FUPA because we thought we had way more than needed 3. The lawsuit cost way more than expected, we spent $15k+ of our own money
@jacksfilms oopsie doopsie I bought me a booksie😍
I think “fame” has definitely made me a worse person overall. More arrogant, defensive, distrustful, cynical. Over the past year I’ve started to hate myself. I hope by saying it, I can try to guide myself to a better state of being.
@HilaKleinH3 You hear that Patrice????
@HilaKleinH3 😬
@joerogan @SophiaHelwani @eddiebravo @BrendanSchaub @ChaelSonnen @MMARoasted @TimKennedyMMA @dc_mma @jeffwagenheim @MMAjunkieGeorge @MMAjunkieJohn @MMAjunkieSteven @MMAjunkieMatt @Benaskren I think fake accounts spam follow popular verified accounts so it looks more legit, so you can't tell which accounts they were actually paid to follow
@GeneralMcBadass Yo dude, do you mind if we use some of the clips from your channel for our video about the DLC? We'll credit ya!

@TeamYouTube @IIJERiiCHOII So if there is no yellow then it doesn't detect strong language and therefore more suitable? What about age-restricted videos?  Are you saying that strong language is enough to merit yellow mark? Aka useage of occasionally f-word etc
@TeamYouTube @IIJERiiCHOII Specifically, are you talking about having a yellow mark?

@kenbone18 🤗
For clarity, NOT talking about SUB-FEED, ONLY HOMEPAGE! Do you see the video on your homepage?
@pewdiepie Ty Felix 🙏 my mistake was not removing the entire video track and just showing a black screen the whole time
Wondering if demonetization affects views... Are you guys seeing new video on homepage?
fixed my dumbass spelling mistake
How ironic that YouTube is demonetizing anything TV-MA that you would see on any tv cable channel, meanwhile YouTube Kids App has managed to become the most depraved part of the entire internet.
*depraved D:
At least the subjects of our videos seem to be enjoying monetization :)
Worked really hard all week on our new video, hope you guys enjoy it :) (Even though it was demonetized before we even published it.)

@PsychoUncle Sorry not enough characters
Now that I can finally type 280 characters let me start by saying that Shrek 2 is probably the best of the series. While Shrek 7 certainly offers a lot in terms of expanding the world around Shrek's swamp, Shrek 2 delivers unforgettable characters like Puss-In-Boot and ogre Fiona

@CaseyNeistat Are we finally all agreeing on this?
@TeamYouTube It should reach everyone that did not previous receive it?
@LiquidSavjz @AskPayPal @PayPal This has been going on for a week, its not our first response, we've tried everything. This is all we see on our paypal account.
@whorgi @AskPayPal @PayPal This has been going on for a week already, tried that, they decided to freeze our account for 180days &amp; ban us for life, no reason provided.
@LiquidSavjz @AskPayPal @PayPal .... does PayPal sponsor liquid or something? Lmao
@LiquidSavjz @AskPayPal @PayPal What?! I am better than this? This is literally the only response I've received from them.
@AskPayPal @PayPal How to destroy a growing business for no reason by PayPal
So @AskPayPal @PayPal just closed our Teddy Fresh account w/ 50% of our revenue stuck in it w/ no possibility of appeal. For 180 days.
@AskPayPal So our account has been closed and frozen for 180 days with 50% of the revenue made for Teddy fresh still inside. Escalate this now PayPal
@AskPayPal our business account has been suspended for almost a week with no response, close to closing down our paypal permanently

@RickandMorty @Coulter_Legal @elonmusk @danharmon @JustinRoiland @MikeMcMahanTM it makes sense that elon would be a fan of rick and morty, what is his IQ, around 220?

@JoeySalads Nothing worse than a self-loathing salad
@JoeySalads I love salad what can I say
@CorridorDigital There is also an argument to make that demonetized or "problematic" videos get less promotion by the algorithm.
@CorridorDigital I also think by denying monetization to some and not others is a form of censorship. Some speech gets rewarded and others punished.
@CorridorDigital Jimmy's &amp; some others have a bypass system not accessible to anyone else that they are working to close.
@CorridorDigital hey dudes, just saw ur video. Wanted to clarify that we do run direct ads &amp; when we get yellowed they DO NOT run on the vid
@FaIcaun Very powerful thanks for letting me know
@FaIcaun Why is that Brandon? 😣

What if I told you.... The Fupa was a lie????
It's ya boi @spiceyyboi from Instagram who made this daddying happen
I'm starting to have really weird fantasies since Hila left...
By reporting on a story without presenting both sides you are effectively taking sides and endorsing the side you report on
"Many people are saying..." is the oldest trick n the book of shady journalism to express a biased opinion w/o actually explicitly saying it
I'm quite drunk by the end there, I'm sure I could have articulated myself better but hey that's me without my carer amiright?
Hi everyone, please enjoy our new podcast :)    We discuss the pewdiepie situation here:

@JustinRoiland Lmao love u bro
@PhillyD @TeamYouTube Lol why would they trend this one?!
@CaseyNeistat @TeamYouTube It's not your fault Casey they just love you 😣
@UnboxTherapy @TeamYouTube My beef is really that it's trending in all of our other top countries besides USA (UK, AUS, ENG, GER, SWE)
@gokaibro @TeamYouTube Which country?
@Editwithmouse @TeamYouTube Which country? It's USA where we seem to be banned
@TeamYouTube -no cursing -no adult content -front page of Reddit 3 times -posted on every tech publication YouTube: let's trend Casey Neistat again
It is clear to me by now that @TeamYouTube 's trending page is completely manipulated. New vid w 3+mil in 12 hours does not trend. Why?
Best line of the entire lawsuit written by our attorney.

@1791L @jordanbpeterson Ah, I didn't see that there was an appeal that was denied. I think the below answer is probably correct, mass flagging resulted in temp ban
@jordanbpeterson It has happened to me before, I wouldn't look too deeply into, it but I'll dig around and see what I can learn. Its likely a strange bug.
@_AlexHirsch Such a great picture 😣😣😣👌👌👌🍆💦 and even greater people 💝🙏🙏🙏

With the click of a button you can exclude all "sensitive" subjects and all new "unlabeled" videos.
The best part is that @TeamYouTube doesn't explain this roll out or how to protect yourself, they just silently screw everyone as usual
New options for advertisers that is resulting in most of us not having ads.

.@TeamYouTube Ads are only showing on Disney vloggers which is what I suppose YouTube wants us all to become.
.@TeamYouTube Thanks to everyone offering to support us on Patreon, but its honestly more about there not being a place for us on YouTube.
I have to be honest, its absolutely soul crushing that there are no ads on our new video. Two in a row. Losing motivation. @TeamYouTube
NEW VIDEO DADDY OF FIVE FT. STEVE-O PLEASE SMASH LIKE   @steveo
@HilaKleinH3 see you guys in our next vlog in three months ^_^
@steveo coming soon boi!
@CaseyNeistat Casey is the only person I'd let touch that and other parts of my body as well
@Apollify @mrbuntyking Yep its that video
@mrbuntyking No. The video got marked as "religious", so no brand chooses to put ads on religion content. No option for appeal.
Half our videos are not running ads bc they are marked as "controversial". I truly feel like we have no place left on YouTube.
To give you an idea of how fucked YouTube is right now. I put "Christian" in the title of new video, got flagged as religious, made nothing
Cutting @steveo 's balls off (NEW VID SOON)
Summer is rapidly approaching, time to start my new look book!

@TobyTurner we love u tony
@KimmiSmiles @pepsi @CocaCola @Starbucks It's just ironic they are trying to protect their brand but the boycott seems to be hurting them more than a few racist vids w little views
.@pepsi @CocaCola @Starbucks Yes, I understand how the free market works. These companies left YouTube to "protect their brand", I'm simply showing them the consequence.
@spastikchuwawa @pepsi @CocaCola @Starbucks Obviously. They did it to "protect their brand", I'm just showing them the consequence of their boycott.
@six50seven @IkaShahinfar @Gusemn @pepsi @CocaCola @Starbucks Let's please not make death threats
.@pepsi @CocaCola @Starbucks post your earning graphs so @pepsi @CocaCola @Starbucks can see how cool their boycott is
Nothing cooler than destroying the livelihood of thousands of independent creators right @pepsi @CocaCola @Starbucks ?

@timheidecker Sheesh you may be right, I just have such a hard time giving them that much credit
@PhillyD But have you had a Pepsi today?
@KEEMSTAR A Warning seems kinda harsh after you handed them a Pepsi
On a serious note, trust me that no one is more disappointed in me than I am. Hope I don't let you guys down like that again.
Thanks to the one and only DizzEthan from /r/h3h3productions for slamming my bradberry

Why we removed our WSJ video
I've privated the video for now, we are looking into other details and will update you guys shortly.
Upon further investigation we found out that the video in question was at some point claimed, meaning we dont know if it was making money
.@TeamYouTube But actually, does anyone see ads on the new video?
No ads on new video thanks @TeamYouTube ! I guess I should just put the N word in the title and get coca cola, toyota, and starbucks!
@psychicpebble the date you see is upload date, it doesnt mean when they took the screen shots, or am i missing something?
@Idubbbz This is bull Frick dude
@garrynewman ....
@DannyYorston Still fricked tho
.@KITKAT Thanks to ya boy Joemonk101 from /r/h3h3productions for this custom ride

@macleanbrendan @DrownedBurrito @pewdiepie sorry about the ytb comments, I'm having a good day, only been told to kill myself 3 times today
@KEEMSTAR @maxmoefoe you could be right but I dont think this glitch is conclusive proof
@KEEMSTAR @maxmoefoe my theory is they changed the way new videos get traffic, usual amount of unsubs is amplified by lack of new traffic
@KEEMSTAR @maxmoefoe I dont think this is proof that people are being unsubbed...cont.
@KEEMSTAR @maxmoefoe
@TeamYouTube Do you know if this related to the notorious unsub glitch rumor that has been going around for the past couple of months?
@TeamYouTube are you guys aware of this mass unsubbing glitch?

@tweetsauce GET-R-DONE
@tweetsauce
@Jessewelle fake pranks = more views because you control the outcome, thats why they fake them in the first place
@Jessewelle I respond to fake pranks once they already have millions. They fake them to make them more juicy. Fake pranks existed before me
@Jessewelle you really think that's why they get more views ?
@JonTronShow was hanging with this dood and he name dropped u, do u know  him or nah?
Pls swipe right
@vanschneider appreciate ya tho 🙏🏼
@vanschneider why are you so ashamed of me 😥
That's it, in solidarity with @pewdiepie I will also be erasing my channel at 50 million subscribers.

@iAmGeorgi are you admitting to predatory contracts? "Don't sign our contracts w/o a lawyer, bc we will screw you"
@honor_the_call happy bday dude!
@mcnPowerTV @Kevin_MMP @KEEMSTAR lets see if they answer within a day before we gotta go medieval
@mcnPowerTV @Kevin_MMP @KEEMSTAR
@mcnPowerTV you removed video of @Kevin_MMP, abuse of power, immoral, probably illegal - release him from contract &amp; publicly apologize
@sebasdelvaux @Kevin_MMP wow
@KEEMSTAR lmao thats insane -- I wanna see that clause from contract
@TrebleT_ @PrestoPrestoo @Kevin_MMP @KEEMSTAR @FUPAforFREEDOM @mcnPowerTV also not sure of legality of sneaking in NDA to contract
@TrebleT_ @PrestoPrestoo @Kevin_MMP @KEEMSTAR @FUPAforFREEDOM @mcnPowerTV if they broke any term then he is certainly free to speak out.
@PrestoPrestoo @Kevin_MMP @KEEMSTAR @FUPAforFREEDOM @mcnPowerTV not necessarily just curious if he is outright lying about it
@Kevin_MMP @KEEMSTAR @FUPAforFREEDOM @mcnPowerTV did you sign an NDA with them?
@KEEMSTAR @Kevin_MMP @FUPAforFREEDOM what does @mcnPowerTV  say?
@EveryVideoEver @wolfieraps I like Wolfie it's just a meme 🙏🏼

@Jack_Septic_Eye @YouTube ty jack 🙏🏼
@pewdiepie lmao
@shaboyaaron drink more sodie pops
@KEEMSTAR I totally agree, activity is such a stupid and pointless metric

@JonTronShow it cracks me up can't even explain why
@JonTronShow I saw it on ur subreddit lel
@KEEMSTAR I liked n commented 🏳️‍🌈
@KEEMSTAR @YouTube playtime still matters, but the activity metric is just given more weight -- I've noticed only our longer vids get shared

@KEEMSTAR yep same here, 300k in 3 hours then no views for next 15 hours...k
@pewdiepie I'm fairly certain at this point that YouTube is trying to kill my channel
@KEEMSTAR we are all robots and @SusanWojcicki is the puppet master

@tailopez I think it was Louis ck, regardless love u thanks for acKNOWLEDGing my existence 🙏 happy Thanksgiving
@pewdiepie ty for da memez
@tailopez nice meme tai!!
@KEEMSTAR wait is leafy a pedo????
@KEEMSTAR I admit there is a double standard but shes not a pedophile, its literally the definition of a word, there is no counter-argument
@KEEMSTAR yes where am i right now
@KEEMSTAR No, and while I agree there is a double standard, she didn't say anything as equally provocative as that.
@KEEMSTAR Why would me becoming a parent change the definition of a word?
@KEEMSTAR pe·do·phile ˈpedəˌfīl/Submit noun a person who is sexually attracted to children.
@KEEMSTAR That being said, those tweets of hers are pretty tasteless, but shes just being a bit cheeky about it, not really pedo.
@KEEMSTAR Pedo means someone who wants to fuck children, I think you've forgotten the definition at this point.
@KEEMSTAR stop it's completely different from sending a child a DM. By your logic all porn stars are pedos bc underage kids watch.
Real headline 2016. "Are Jews people?" You decide, tonight at 8:00.

@ColossalisCrazy @BionicPIGtv I disagree but hey papa bless
@ColossalisCrazy @BionicPIGtv crime in the proverbial sense of wrong doing
@ColossalisCrazy @BionicPIGtv yes but there is no victim, no lie, no deception, everyone is happy so where is the crime?
@KEEMSTAR BITCH YOU STREAM AND BEG ON TWITCH ALL DAY, I'm sure you need TWITCH  donations and subs right keem? (Congrats on new house)
@sivemorten @KEEMSTAR @Zaptie @ColossalisCrazy @ImAllexx @BionicPIGtv check our patreon trailer but I agree, we did when we made it though
@ColossalisCrazy @BionicPIGtv no it's not but it's also not a bad thing, it's honest and helps people, people are not forced to give
@ColossalisCrazy @BionicPIGtv that's right but what is inherently wrong with that ?
@KEEMSTAR @Zaptie @ColossalisCrazy @ImAllexx @BionicPIGtv streaming is worse than patreon when you are on stream begging&amp;encouraging keem
@ColossalisCrazy @BionicPIGtv I dont really see your point here, if people are willing to support him to dedicate himself to making videos
@RyanAbe 🙏

@RodneyLohse7 Ok, good advice, thanks for the chat!
@RodneyLohse7 Haha, definitely!
@RodneyLohse7 This kind of thing has happened before on YouTube, false copyright being used to censor negative press.
@RodneyLohse7 As you can see, it was them that removed the video, on a false copyright claim.
@RodneyLohse7 CDS is a large YouTube network that manages a lot of these prank channels, they are essentially Adrian's managers on YT.
@RodneyLohse7 It was claimed by Collective Digital Studios, they are censoring the video. Would you mind following me so we could direct msg
@RodneyLohse7 With your permission, Adrian and his network would have no legal basis to remove our video. Thank you!
@RodneyLohse7 I would like to make a video about it, and I was wondering if I had your permission to use your original clip + to post it
@RodneyLohse7 If you click this link   you can see his network has claimed ownership, removing it on copyright grounds
@RodneyLohse7 I'm wondering if you were aware that the viral video on YouTube was removed by Adrian Gee's Network? If you click this link..
@TodayTonightSA Would you be available to speak briefly about it? Your video is being censored illegally on YouTube.
@TodayTonightSA Hey Adelaide, are you aware that Adrian's youtube network removed the videos you guys made from youtube on copyright?
